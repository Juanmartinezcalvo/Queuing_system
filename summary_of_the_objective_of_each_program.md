Airport Simulation Program

This program simulates the operations of an airport, focusing on various service counters such as:

Check-in
Passport control
Security checks
Boarding
The simulation uses variables to define the number of counters available for each service. The optimal number of counters for each service has been determined using the Monte Carlo method, which is detailed in a separate file included in this repository.

This project can be used to analyze bottlenecks, optimize service capacity, or study passenger behavior under different conditions.
